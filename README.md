# Data Engineering ND #3: Data Warehouse
## Overview
**Data Warehouse** is the third project of Udacity [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/documents/en-US/Data+Engineering+Nanodegree+Program+Syllabus.pdf). The goal of the project is to work with data warehouses and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). It requires to build an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) pipeline that:
* Extracts music streaming data from [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets
* Stages extracted data in [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)
* Transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for analytics team
## Repo Contents
The repo contains the following files:
* ```create_tables.py```: drops existing tables and creates new ones.
* ```etl.py```: loads data from S3 to Redshift staging tables, and inserts extracted data into analytics tables.
* ```sql_queries.py```: contains all SQL queries.
## Database
### Database Purpose
A music streaming startup, *Sparkify*, wants to move their processes and data onto the cloud. They need a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to find insights in what songs their users are listening to. 
### Project Datasets
*Sparkify* data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
#### Song Dataset ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. 

Below is an example of what a single song file ```data/song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJV128F1460C49.json``` looks like.
```
{
  "num_songs": 1, 
  "artist_id": "ARIK43K1187B9AE54C", 
  "artist_latitude": null, 
  "artist_longitude": null, 
  "artist_location": "Beverly Hills, CA", 
  "artist_name": "Lionel Richie", 
  "song_id": "SOBONFF12A6D4F84D8", 
  "title": "Tonight Will Be Alright", 
  "duration": 307.3824, 
  "year": 1986
}
```
#### Log Dataset ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```
Log data json path: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json```.

This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by [eventsim](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) event simulator based on the songs in the song dataset. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

Below is an example of what a single line of a single file ```data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-09-events.json``` looks like.
```
